# Bike Sharing Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to compile given bike sharing data to draw conclusions about the overall usage and make decisions about the possibility of expansion and potential success in other regions. 


## Results

Here we can see that the overwhelming majority of recorded trips were less than 20 minutes from start to finish.

When we add the gender filter we can see that while male users are the overwhelming majority of the given dataset, the checkout time trends are the same across all reported user genders.

When we created a heatmap to visualize the highest concentrations of usage by day of the week and time we can see that there is a clear pattern of usage spikes during typical morning and evening commute times as well as weekend afternoons.

Here we added the gender filter and again, while the male users have a higher concentration the checkout trends remain the same indicating that gender is not a significant factor when determining trip times.

When comparing single customers to subscribers we can see that male subscribers comprise the majority of rides on all days of the week.

This map shows the high concentration of starting locations

While this map shows the ending locations. We can see when comparing the two maps that it reaffirms our previous conclusions that the majority of trips are short in duration.


## Summary

In conclusion, in order to make decisions about whether this bikesharing program would translate well in another market we would want to gather information in the new city about current commute needs. All of the above information affirms that most subscribers are using the bike service to commute short distances concentrated in the inner city. If we were to analyze the current data further it could prove beneficial to see if user age proves to be a more significant factor when paired with trip duration and days/times of usage. This could provide helpful information to compare to the proposed new city and their age demographics.
